# Super-Resolution
Final project in deep learning. Super resolution on images using U-Net
Thats my final project in deep learning. I use a pre-trained ResNet34 and changed its architecture to that of a U-Net.
Credit to the FastAI course for the techniques used here.
I used Google Colab pro for the training of the neural network.
